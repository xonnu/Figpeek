## Pretty short story out there eh

See [Issue #12](https://github.com/xuronno/Figpeek/issues/12)

The actual maintainer named @xuronno, agree to make his work publicly despite he really do this as a hobby before he get landing on the job (I hope he didn't get angry to this :pray:)

Me, as myself I want to keep his one of the hobbyist projects to revive and to maintain for now we just wanted to release this with the domain thru Vercel by the way we need to add some more missing features all thru my hands.

In terms of security we just wanted to live it prone to any kinds we only use NPM during initialization so when you use to run with YARN and PNPM is kind of broken to run this project.

We released this project under General Public License (GPL v3) under Free Software Foundation
Feel free to do anything you want here in this project we must committed to 4 essentials of user's freedom.
